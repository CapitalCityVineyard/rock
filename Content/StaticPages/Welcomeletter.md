Thank you so much for choosing to worship with us at Capital City Vineyard Church recently. I want you to know that your presence with us was noticed and appreciated. Our purpose and passion at CCV is connecting people to God and to one another in authentic deepening relationships. We hope you began to experience that during your visit, and felt warmly welcomed among us. We certainly invite and encourage you to join us again for any of our Sunday worship gatherings whenever you can.

If you’re looking for a new church home and you do feel God may be leading you to explore connecting with us further, I would enjoy an opportunity to speak with you personally to share a bit more about the vision and values of our church.  In the next week or so, I will call or email to follow-up on your visit, and see if you would like to speak more about this.  If you have any further questions about the Vineyard, or the faith we embrace, we could talk about them at that time.

Just want you to know that I’m happy to serve you and help you get to know us better in any way that I can.  Thanks again for visiting with us!

That He Might Increase (John 3:30),
